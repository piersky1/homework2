# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

## Description 

This is a design concept for my own personal, responsive web developer portfolio. It consists of three pages:

* Home

* Portfolio

* Contact

I built this using Bootstrap 4, a popular CSS framework originally from Twitter for creating responsive websites. Check out the official Bootstrap website for help getting started on your own projects: [https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/)

Bootstrap makes it easy to get a responsive website up and running in minutes with pre-styled components. I made minor tweaks to the HTML and CSS to personalize it. My favorite part was adding the color gradient backgrounds in pure CSS. It gives the site a professional look and feel and reminds me of Apple's color pallete for their marketing and branding (see credits).

Also, on the homepage I linked to IBM's Call for Code for Racial Justice. As an Asian American developer I hope my work can make a positive impact on not only my local community, but the world.

Note, I purposefully did not include canonical links or meta descriptions as this project is only a design concept, for educational use only. I tagged it as "noindex" to avoid being included in search engine result pages.
